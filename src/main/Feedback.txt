Feedback:


Good:
Constants were placed into a separate file for easy access and made it easy to extend the values or change them.
Informative Comments
MVC approach
Unit tests were easy to modify and working properly

Bad:
Included unnecessary annotations.
There were times when autowiring of variables could have caused a concurrency issue leading to users seeing values they did not enter.
There was repetitive code.
Loan length values were set from 6 months to 60 months, but the ticket asked for 12 to 48 months.
